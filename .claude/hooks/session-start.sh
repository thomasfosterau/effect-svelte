#
# Provision a checkout for NON-INTERACTIVE use.
#
# One file, two callers — the Claude Code SessionStart hook and the
# devcontainer's `postCreateCommand` (which invokes this file directly) — so a
# container shell and an agent session are provisioned identically.
#
# ## Vite+ first
#
# Vite+ (`vp`) is the one tool this script guarantees; everything else is
# reached through it. The global CLI is installed at exactly the `vite-plus`
# version pinned in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`'s catalog, using the official
# installer, which takes the release from the npm registry, refuses a package
# without npm provenance and checks its SHA-512 `dist.integrity`. It installs
# under `$VP_HOME` (else `~/.local/share/vite-plus`) and touches no shell profile, so `vp` and
# `vpx` are then linked into `~/.local/bin`, which is on PATH in the session
# container (an `export` here cannot reach the caller's later shells; a
# symlink to the real binary can).
#
# From there:
#
# - `vp install --frozen-lockfile` installs the dependencies.
# - The global `vp` delegates development commands to the project-local
#   `vite-plus`, including inside `.claude/worktrees/*`, so each checkout runs
#   its own pinned toolchain without a shim.
# - Project tools run through Vite+: `vp exec fallow …` for fallow (the commit
#   gate does the same), `vpx <file>.ts` for TypeScript scripts. Nothing else
#   is put on PATH: no shim walks a directory tree, and nothing runs a
#   `node_modules/.bin` the session did not install.
#
# Earlier versions of this hook symlinked `fallow` and `tsx` into
# `~/.local/bin` and wrote a `vp` re-exec shim there that walked up from $PWD;
# those are removed or replaced when found (only ones this hook made: a
# symlink into a `node_modules`, or a file carrying the generator marker).
#
# If the installer cannot run (no network to vite.plus / viteplus.dev, or the
# catalog pin cannot be read), `vp` falls back to a one-line re-exec of this
# project's own `node_modules/vite-plus/bin/vp`, and the hook says so.
#
# ## Node, and why this repairs rather than clobbers
#
# `~/.vite-plus/bin/node` is a shim pointing at the `vp` launcher, which
# resolves a Node version and installs it under `~/.vite-plus/js_runtime`.
# When that directory is not writable by the session user and the resolved
# version drifts past the cached one, the shim fails with `Permission denied`.
# This script therefore *tests* `node --version` and only
# replaces the shim when it is already broken, pointing it at a real cached
# binary. A working shim is left alone.
#
# ## Secrets
#
# This hook hydrates NO secrets, and this repository needs none: every gate
# runs offline against the lockfile. Publishing is the release workflow's job
# and uses npm OIDC trusted publishing (PUBLISHING.md).
#
# ## Contract
#
# Idempotent, and never fatal. Every failure path logs and continues, because
# the SessionStart hook must not block a session and a half-provisioned
# container is more useful than a container that refused to start.
#
# Untrusted-content note: the only value read from the repository is the
# `vite-plus` catalog version, and it is used only when it is a plain
# `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Do not add other repository input without revisiting
# this note — it runs on every session start and container create.
